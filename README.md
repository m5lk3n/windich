# Windich

![](assets/icon/icon-small.png)

Your companion for outdoor activities, providing forecasted and real-time weather information like wind speed and wind direction using your device's sensors and geolocation. An app for Android and one of my pet projects. For now.

Screenshots can be found [here](device_screens/screenshots/APP.md).
