<summary>... to create an animated GIF out of (3) PNGs</summary>

Here‚Äôs how you can turn your 3 PNGs into a smooth, transparent animated GIF in GIMP:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open your PNGs as layers

1. Launch GIMP.

2. Go to File ‚Üí Open as Layers‚Ä¶

3. Select the three PNGs ([frame1.png](../assets/animate/frame1.png), [frame2.png](../assets/animate/frame2.png), [frame3.png](../assets/animate/frame3.png)).
‚Üí They will appear stacked in the Layers panel.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Arrange the frames

- Make sure the layers are in the right order (bottom = first frame).

- Rename them to include timing, e.g.:

   ```
    frame-1 (200ms)
    frame-2 (200ms)
    frame-3 (200ms)
   ```

(The text in parentheses sets the duration per frame in GIMP‚Äôs GIF exporter.)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Export as GIF

1. Go to File ‚Üí Export As‚Ä¶

2. Choose a name, e.g. [icon.gif](../assets/animate/icon.gif).

3. In the export dialog:

   - Check As animation.

   - Enable Loop forever (if you want it to repeat).

   - Set Delay between frames (e.g. 200 ms if you didn‚Äôt add timing in layer names).

   - Set Frame disposal to One frame per layer (replace) or Combine (try both; ‚ÄúReplace‚Äù often works best for transparency).

4Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Improve color quality

GIF is limited to 256 colors, so you may want to:

1. Go to Image ‚Üí Mode ‚Üí Indexed‚Ä¶

2. Choose Generate optimum palette with 256 colors and enable Dithering (Floyd‚ÄìSteinberg).

3. Then export again.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Preview

Open the exported GIF in any browser or image viewer to check the flicker.

üí° Tip: If the GIF still looks grainy, consider exporting as WebP animation instead (File ‚Üí Export As ‚Üí `.webp`) ‚Äî it supports full color and transparency.
